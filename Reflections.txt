- Reflection on mocking in 2.1 and 2.2:
Looking at my (Angel) repo, I feel like I did good mocking since I used dependency injection by 
creating a mock datasource class, then passing that into the cache itself so it doesn't have to make an API call.

- Reflection on mocking in 3.1:
Our current mock data is being stored as a list of JSON, I don't think too much will need to change since the 
overall structure of the data is being stored as a JSON already, but I'm sure issues will arise when we integrate the backend.

Meta Reflection:

1 - Yes, it was very new to the both of us since we have minimal experience in Typescript and no experience using react. 
It felt like the design of the website was also very important, which we don't have experience designing websites so that was very new.

2 - It didn't feel too new honestly, the testing felt the same but it was cool to get a report generated of our tests passing across different browsers
as well as being able to test using the website without having to use the website.

3 - One bug encountered was that initally boolean values were not being represented in the table on the website, which was odd since 
special characters and numbers were being shown, we just had to change select history to consider 
what to do when a value is a boolean.
