> **GETTING STARTED:** You should likely start with the `/mock` folder from your solution code for the mock gearup.

# Project Details
This project is a mock gear-up application that involves selection interfaces, dropdowns, and a history tracking component. The core functionality revolves around rendering options from mock data and enabling interactions such as selections and history management.
# Design Choices
The design focuses on modularity, with components like SelectInput, SelectHistory, and LoginButton handling specific functionalities. The /mock folder serves as a starting point, containing mocked data for development and testing purposes. CSS styles are split across multiple files (App.css, index.css, main.css) to maintain the visual consistency and adaptability of components across different screen sizes and user preferences.
# Errors/Bugs
While the app functions as intended, there are potential layout issues that could arise with the dropdown alignment and button positioning. One known issue (noted in main.css) is the need to refine the centering of the submit button. Future work includes refining this and ensuring responsive design across devices.
# Tests
Component Rendering: Tests ensure that the main components, including SelectInput, SelectHistory, and LoginButton, render correctly without errors.

User Interactions: Simulated user interactions, such as dropdown selections and history management, are tested to ensure the correct response is triggered. These include selecting an item from the dropdown, submitting it, and checking if it appears in the selection history.

Mock Data Validation: Tests verify that the application accurately uses the mocked data for rendering the selection options.

UI Consistency: The tests also focus on ensuring consistent UI behavior across different states and ensure that the dropdown is correctly populated with data and the history list updates upon selection.
# How to
Start by navigating to the /mock folder to understand the mocked data and components.
Use npm start (or similar command) to initiate the mock application.
For style changes, refer to App.css, index.css, and main.css to update UI elements.
